# Physical Computing 2016-2017 Code
Stored in this repo will be the miscellaneous code from my 11th grade Physical Computing class that has no other repository location. For more work from this class, also check out my gists from September 2016 or newer: https://gist.github.com/DataManiac18 

This year, I also worked a bunch on the <a href="https://github.com/DotSlash-CTF/Bulldog.git">Bulldog Repo<a/> in the DotSlash organization (DotSlash is made up of everyone in the Physical Computing class)
